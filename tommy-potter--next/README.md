# Tommy Potter — A Showcase Web App Built with Next.js & Headless WordPress

This project is a quick showcase designed to demonstrate my ability to create visually appealing and responsive web applications.

I chose **Next.js** and **WordPress** based on their popularity and the maturity of their ecosystems.

- The app is built using **Next.js (App Router enabled)** to take advantage of its latest features.
- **WordPress** is deployed on a VPS using **Docker Compose** and functions as a headless CMS.
- **Tailwind CSS** is used for fast, utility-first styling with a clean and modern design.
